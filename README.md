# google_maps_in_flutter

Demo based on - Adding Google Maps to a Flutter App [ https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter/#0 ]

## Run the project

### Add api key for google maps services
You'll need to enable google maps services in a google cloud platform project and create an api key to access the services. After that, you'll have to insert your api key in 2 files inside the project (just serch for "api_key_here"). The files are:

`AndroidManifest.xml` file and in `AppDelegate.swift`.
